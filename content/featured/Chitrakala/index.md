Cloned Furlenco, an app for renting furniture in major cities in India, with two fellow trainees in four days.
Used Lottie Animations, ViewPager, Shared Preferences, etc., to implement features like adding the furniture to the cart, saving the selected city during login screens. Created our own JSON file for API calling.
