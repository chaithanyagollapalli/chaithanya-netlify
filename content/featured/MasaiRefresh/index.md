Cloned the USAToday news app with two fellow trainees in four days. The whole app was made with MVVM architecture and close-to-original looking layouts. Using MySQL database, we created the required database and connected the app to the database using SpringBoot. Implemented the main features of the app like saving the news for later and sharing news on messaging apps.
