Cloned Vyapar, an app used for managing expenses and sales of any kind of business, with three other fellow trainees in four days.
The whole app was made with MVVM architecture and close-to-original looking layouts.
Used Room database to save the data locally. Implemented features like updating the expense and sales amount dynamically as we add expenses and sales, sharing the transaction details.
